# NVIDIA  - The GPU Juggernaut

# Overview and Origin

## NVIDIA

## IPO: January 22, 1999

## Founders: Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, Curtis Preim

## Like many Silicon Valley tech companies the origin story of NVIDIA is a humble one.  The founders created the company at Denny's
## restaurant in East San Jose. The basis of the company was the forecasted growth in accelerated computing, especially as it related
## to graphics-based processing. Video games provided the founds with some of the most computationally complex problems and high sales
## volume.

## Nvidia was started with just $40,000 dollars, pooled from the three founders.  This "seed" money was soon joined with $20 Milllion
## of venture capital funds from Sequoia Capital and others.  Roughly $42 Million was raised from their IPO in early 
## 1999 - [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB917224371262043000)

# Business Activities

## NVIDIA has branched out into many other areas of computing since that day at Denny's back in 1993.  They have made significant impacts
## in the areas of automotive computer chips and self driving cars as well, AI, healthcare anlaysis and devices, and robotics.
## Through this exapansion they haven't lost site of their originial focus of graphics-based processing.  It is estimated that in 2023 NVIDIA
## held an 80% share of GPU (graphics processing units) globally.

## NVIDIA has selected an area of focus that has a broad and growing consumer base.  Every CPU, laptop, tablet, and cell phone has a GPU for graphics processing at minimum.  
## As most consumers own many of these devices, nd in many cases replaces them regularly the market for GPUs is expansive, and not likely to become saturated or stale.
## While gaming and video streaming provide one set of customers, GPUs are also needed for data-heavy AI processing - which is perhapse the fastest growing area of tech
## right now.

## NVIDIA is currently offering a unique solution in the market they've coined Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) that partitians the GPU into
## as many as 7 instances, each with their own bandwidth.

>Without MIG, different jobs running on the same GPU, such as different AI inference requests, compete for the same resources. A job consuming larger memory bandwidth
>starves others, resulting in several jobs missing their latency targets. With MIG, jobs run simultaneously on different instances, each with dedicated resources
>for compute, memory, and memory bandwidth, resulting in predictable performance with QoS and maximum GPU utilization.

# Landscape & Results

## NVIDIA is by far the largest manufacturer of GPUs, which has landed them in legal trouble more than once with governments raise 'competition concerns'. The company has
## several competitors in the market place including AMD, Intel, Apple, and ASUS. NVIDIA has also been navigating the perilous chip wars between the US and China.  
## Increasingly, the US is blocking chips manufactured in China due spying concerns.

## NVIDIA stock rose 240% in 2023, driving the value of the company over $1 Trillion dollars.  In early 2024, storng trading was replaced with metoroic rises and NVIDIA 
##crossed the $2 Trillion dollar mark in early 2024.

# Recommendation

## As the tension between China and the US regarding chip manufacturing exports, NVIDIA may find it beneficial to seek manufacturers outside of China to product their chips.
A diversivied production network will provide stability for the company as the US places new export regularions on Chinese manufactueres.  Additionally, NVIDIA needs
## to ensure they have strong lobbists. As regulations around AI and it's capabilities come to the forefront, it will be imperative that chip manufactureres have their voice
represented in the discussion.
